        <h3>Italian Society is under attack!</h3>
        <p>Pineapple on Pizza is unnatural, the heritage of Italy is being descerated by these bright tropical mostrosities littering it's rich baked top.
            <br>Rome was not built with pineapples and the good people of Italy did not oust Mussolini to have another dictator run amuck on their beautiful pizza!

        <h3>We can't let the Hosers win!</h3>
        <p>Pineapple on Pizza was made in Canada, we cannot allow the Canucks to invade our stomachs again!
            <br>Wasn't maple syrup and poutine enough?

        <h3>Pineapple on Pizza is just plain gross</h3>
        <p>EW! Don't believe me? Order one... Go ahead... order one...
            <br>I'll wait...
            <br>
            <br>Did you get one?
            <br>
            <br>Not very good was it...
            <br>
            <br>Or you probably didn't order it at all cause it would have been a waste of money...
            <br>
            <br>Now go get some real food like a Baconator meal with fries and a medium coke at your local Wendy's! 
            <br>Available in any Wendy's across the US and Canada for 13.99 (local taxes may apply)
