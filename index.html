    <h2>Greatest invention of the whole humanity</h2>
    <h3>Sweet and Savory Combination</h3>
    <p>One of the main arguments for pineapple pizza is that <br>
        it offers a unique and delicious combination of sweet and savory flavors. <br>
        The sweetness of the pineapple complements the saltiness of the ham or bacon <br>
        and the richness of the cheese, creating a well-balanced taste.</p>

    <h3>Invented in Canada</h3>
    <p>Hawaiian pizza is an example of cultural fusion. It was <br>
        created in Canada and is inspired by Hawaiian flavors. This fusion represents <br>
        the globalization of food and the ability to bring together diverse culinary traditions.</p>

    <h3>It isn't that bad!</h3>
    <p>Pineapple adds a juicy and tender texture to the pizza, <br>

        <h3>Italian Society is under attack!</h3>
        <p>Pineapple on Pizza is unnatural, the heritage of Italy is being descerated by these bright tropical mostrosities littering it's rich baked top.
            <br>Rome was not built with pineapples and the good people of Italy did not oust Mussolini to have another dictator run amuck on their beautiful pizza!

        <h3>We can't let the Hosers win!</h3>
        <p>Pineapple on Pizza was made in Canada, we cannot allow the Canucks to invade our stomachs again!
            <br>Wasn't maple syrup and poutine enough?
        </p>

        <h3>Pineapple on Pizza is just plain gross</h3>
        <p>EW! Don't believe me? Order one... Go ahead... order one...
            <br>I'll wait...
            <br>
            <br>Did you get one?
            <br>
            <br>Not very good was it...
            <br>
            <br>Or you probably didn't order it at all cause it would have been a waste of money...
            <br>
            <br>Now go get some real food like a Baconator meal with fries and a medium coke at your local Wendy's! 
            <br>Available in any Wendy's across the US and Canada for 13.99 (local taxes may apply)
